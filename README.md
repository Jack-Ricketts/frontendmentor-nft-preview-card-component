## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Pseudo-classes
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped to create a flexbox component.
- [Image overlay guide](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped to create a hover type image. Still need a lot of practice with this. And I do not like the solution so it need an update in the future.
